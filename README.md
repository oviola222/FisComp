# Computational Physics - PPGFIS (UFU) - 2025/1

Welcome to the repository for the course **Computational Physics**, offered during the first semester of 2025 as part of the Graduate Program in Physics (**PPGFIS**) at the **Federal University of Uberlândia (UFU)** by **Prof. Dr. Gerson J. Ferreira** [(Gerson's Git)](https://github.com/gersonjferreira).

## 👤 About me

My name is **Olavo Viola**, a graduate student (MSc) in Physics at UFU [(see my ResearchGate)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Olavo-Viola?ev=hdr_xprf). This repository documents the activities developed throughout the course, including individual and group projects. Here you will find source code, simulations and computational experiments related to physics problems and neural networks.

## 🖥️ About the course
   ⌨️🖱️

**Computational Physics** introduces and applies modern computational tools and techniques to solve problems in physics. Throughout the semester, we are exploring topics such as:

- Object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python
- Neural Networks from Scratch (NNFS)
- 

## 📌 Current topic: NNFS

At this stage of the course, we are working on building and training a simple **artificial neural network** by following the **Neural Networks from Scratch (NNFS)** approach, which emphasizes understanding and implementing each component manually using Python.

The main goals of this phase are:

- Understand the internal structure of feedforward neural networks
-
